He retained but a vague m
emory of his parents and felt neither
affection nor
 gratitude for t
em. He hardly knew his father, who
usually resided 
in Paris. He recall
ed his mother as she lay motionles
in a dim room of t
he Chateau
 de Lourps. The 
husband and wife would
meet on r
are occasions, and he remembered those lifeless interviews
when his parents 
sat face to face in front of a round table faintly
lit by a lamp 
with a wide, l
ow-hanging shade, for the _duchesse_ could
not endure li
ght or soun
d without being seized 
with a fit of
nervousness.
A
few, halting words wou
ld be exchanged between them in
the gloom and th
en the 
indifferent _duc_ 
would depart to meet the
first train ba
ck to Paris.
Jean's life 
at the Jesuit s
chool, where he
 was sent to study, was more
pleasant. At fir
st the Fathers 
pampered the lad
 whose intelligence
astonished them.
 But despite thei
r efforts, they cou
ld not induce him
to concentrate
 on studies requ
iring discipline. He
 nibbled at various
books and was
 precociously bri
lliant in Latin. On th
e contrary, he was
absolutely incapa
ble of construing two Greek words, showed no aptitude
for living langu
age
s and promptly p
roved himse
lf a dunce when obliged
to master t
he elements of the sciences.
His family gave
 him little heed
. Sometimes his father visited him at
school. "How ar
e you . . . be g
ood . . . study hard . . . "--and he
was gone. The l
ad passed the summ
er vacations at the Chateau de
Lourps, but his p
resence could not 
seduce his mother from her
reveries. She sca
rcely noticed him; 
when she did, her gaze would rest
on him for a moment
 with a sad smil
e--and that was 
all. The moment
after she would 
again become absorbed in the artificial night with
which the heavily 
curtained windows
 enshrouded the room.
The servants were
 old and dull
. Left to himself, the boy delved into
books on rain
y days and ro
amed about the countryside on pleasant
afternoons.
It was his supr
eme delight to
 wander down th
e little valley to
Jutigny, a villag
e planted at th
e foot of the h
ills, a tiny heap of
cottages capped 
with thatch strew
n with tufts of s
engreen and clumps
of moss. In th
e open fields, 
under the shadow o
f high ricks, he would
lie, listening to
 the hollow splashin
g of the mills and 
inhaling the
fresh breeze from V
oulzie. Sometimes h
 went as far as the
 peat-bogs,
to the green and bl
ack hamlet of Long
ueville, or climbe
 wind-swept
hillsides affording 
magnificent views.
 There, below to o
ne side, as
far as the eye
 could reach, la
y the Seine val
ley, blending in the
distance with th
e blue sky; high
 up, near the h
orizon, on the other
side, rose the ch
urches and tower of
 Provins which seemed to tremble
in the golden dust of the air.
